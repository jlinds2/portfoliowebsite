        <h2>Found a Passion for Tech Design in Art School</h2>
        <img src="images/IMG_3458.gif" alt="">
        <p>I went into art school interested in painting. I enjoy learning about the technical. This includes composition, color theory, perspective ect. I found Ux/Ui design applies the same passions and thoughts as painting. Use technical skills to create visuals that can help users. I also enjoy having the skills to build these ideas myself which is why I use WordPress and HTML/CSS/JQUERY.</p>
